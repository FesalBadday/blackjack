    <ol>
      <li>The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</li>
      <li>Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.</li>
      <li>Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.</li>
      <li>A push is when you and the dealer have the same hand value. When this happens your bet will be returned. You don't win anything and you don't lose anything.</li>
      <li>Hit: Take another card.</li>
      <li>Stand: Take no more cards.</li>
      <li>All In: You play with all of your money.</li>
      <li>Double X2: Increase the initial bet by 100% and take exactly one more card. </li>
      <li>The dealer stands on 18.</li>
      <li>A double is only allowed in the first round.</li>
      <li>Leaderboard: You have to log in to save your scores or you can play as a guest but your scores will not be saved.</li>
      <li>Have fun.</li>
